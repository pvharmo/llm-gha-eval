For each object in the [{'name': 'yoga', 'openstack_version': 'stable/yoga', 'ubuntu_version': '20.04'}, {'name': 'xena', 'openstack_version': 'stable/xena', 'ubuntu_version': '20.04'}, {'name': 'wallaby', 'openstack_version': 'stable/wallaby', 'ubuntu_version': '20.04'}, {'name': 'victoria', 'openstack_version': 'stable/victoria', 'ubuntu_version': '20.04'}, {'name': 'ussuri', 'openstack_version': 'stable/ussuri', 'ubuntu_version': '18.04'}, {'name': 'train', 'openstack_version': 'stable/train', 'ubuntu_version': '18.04'}] list, the key:value pairs in the object will be added to each of the matrix combinations if none of the key:value pairs overwrite any of the original matrix values. If the object cannot be added to any of the matrix combinations, a new matrix combination will be created instead. The job `functional-identity` has 6 steps. The 1st step is named `Checkout Gophercloud`. This step runs action `actions/checkout` tagged as v3. The 2nd step is named `Deploy devstack`. This step runs action `EmilienM/devstack-action` tagged as v0.9. The step defines an input parameter for the action: `branch` is set to `${{ matrix.openstack_version }}`. The 3rd step is named `Checkout go`. This step runs action `actions/setup-go` tagged as v3. The step defines an input parameter for the action: `go-version` is set to `^1.15`. The 4th step is named `Run Gophercloud acceptance tests`. The step sets 2 environment variables to use: `DEVSTACK_PATH` is set to `${{ github.workspace }}/devstack` and `ACCEPTANCE_TESTS_FILTER` is set to `^.*identity.*$`. This step runs a script: `./script/acceptancetest`. The 5th step is named `Generate logs on failure`. This step will run only if the condition(failure()) is met. This step runs a script: `./script/collectlogs`. The 6th step is named `Upload logs artifacts on failure`. This step will run only if the condition(failure()) is met. This step runs action `actions/upload-artifact` tagged as v3. The step defines 2 input parameters for the action: `name` is set to `functional-identity-${{ matrix.name }}` and `path` is set to `/tmp/devstack-logs/*`. "}

This workflow will be triggered by an event: a pull request is closed. The workflow would run whenever there is a pull_request event targeting: a branch named main. The workflow modifies the default permissions for the GITHUB_TOKEN: read access is granted to the GITHUB_TOKEN in the `pull-requests` scope. This permission setting applies to all jobs in the workflow. The workflow has one job. The job id of the 1st job is `approval`. This job will run on ubuntu-latest runner. The job `approval` has 2 steps. The 1st step is named `Fail If No Approval`. This step will run only if the condition(${{ github.event.pull_request.merged }}) is met. The step sets 3 environment variables to use: `AUTH_HEADER` is set to `Authorization: token ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`, `JSON_HEADER` is set to `Content-Type: application/json` and `REVIEWS_URL` is set to `https://api.github.com/repos/${{ github.repository }}/pulls/${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}/reviews`. This step runs a script: `curl -sSL -H \"${JSON_HEADER}\" -H \"${AUTH_HEADER}\" \"${REVIEWS_URL}\" \\\n  | jq -e '. | map({user: .user.login, state: .state})\n             | reduce .[] as $x ({}; .[$x.user] = $x.state)\n             | to_entries | map(.value)\n             | contains([\"APPROVED\"]) and (contains([\"CHANGES_REQUESTED\"]) | not)'\n`. The 2nd step is named `Slack Notification`. This step will run only if the condition(${{ failure() }}) is met. This step runs a script: `jq --null-input '{ text: \"Oh no! The following PR was merged without approval: w${{github.event.pull_request.html_url}}\" }' \\\n| curl -sSL -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d @- '${{ secrets.SLACK_MERGE_WITHOUT_APPROVAL_WEBHOOK }}'\n`.
