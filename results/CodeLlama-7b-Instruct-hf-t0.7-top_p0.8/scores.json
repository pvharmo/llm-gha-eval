Run CVE crawler\n\nThe `checkout` step uses the `actions/checkout@v2` action to check out the code in the repository. The `setup-python` step uses the `actions/setup-python@v2` action to set up the Python environment with the specified version (3.x). The `install-dependencies` step uses the `pip` command to install the dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file.

Convert README to PDF: This step uses the `baileyjm02/markdown-to-pdf@v1.1.0` action to convert the README file to a PDF file. The `input` parameter is set to the value of the `github.ref` variable, which contains the branch or tag that triggered the workflow. The `output` parameter is set to the value of the `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` variable, which contains the GitHub token for the repository.\n3. Commit files: This step uses the `run` keyword to execute a shell command that adds all files to the Git index and commits them with a message.\n4. Push changes: This step uses the `ad-m/github-push-action@master` action to push the changes to the repository. The `token` parameter is set to the value of the `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` variable.\n\nNote that this is just a sample workflow, and you may need to modify it to fit your specific needs.

Build Changelog\n9. Create Github Release\n\nThe `Bump version and push tag` step uses the `anothrNick/github-tag-action` action to bump the version number and push a new tag to the repository. The `Set up QEMU` and `Set up Docker Buildx` steps use the `docker/setup-qemu-action` and `docker/setup-buildx-action` actions to set up the QEMU and Docker Buildx environments. The `Login to DockerHub` and `Login to Quay.io` steps use the `docker/login-action` action to log in to the DockerHub and Quay.io registries. The `Build and push` step uses the `docker/build-push-action` action to build and push the Docker image to the DockerHub and Quay.io registries. The `Build Changelog` step uses the `mikepenz/release-changelog-builder-action` action to generate the changelog for the release. The `Create Github Release` step uses the `actions/create-release` action to create a new release in the GitHub repository.\n\nThe workflow uses several variables, including `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`, `secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME`, `secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD`, `secrets.QUAY_BOT_USERNAME`, `secrets.QUAY_BOT_PASSWORD`, `steps.tagging.outputs.tag`, and `steps.build_changelog.outputs.changelog`.

The action takes two inputs: `openstack_version` and `name`, which are defined in the matrix strategy.\n3. `Checkout go`: This step uses the `actions/checkout@v3` action to checkout the `go` repository.\n4. `Run Gophercloud acceptance tests`: This step uses the `go test` command to run the acceptance tests for `Gophercloud`. The command includes the `-coverprofile=coverage.txt -covermode=atomic` flags to generate coverage reports.\n5. `Generate logs on failure`: This step uses the `cat` command to generate a log file named `failure.log` if the previous step fails. The log file contains the output of the `go test` command.\n6. `Upload logs artifacts on failure`: This step uses the `actions/upload-artifact@v3` action to upload the `failure.log` file as an artifact if the previous step fails.

The first step is a `Cache` step that uses the `actions/cache` action to cache the CMake and C++ compilers. The cache key is the GitHub ref (branch or tag) and the restore key is the GitHub ref.\n2. The second step is a `Setup` step that runs the following commands:\n\t* `sudo apt-get update`\n\t* `sudo apt-get install -y cmake`\n\t* `sudo apt-get install -y ccache`\n3. The third step is a `Build` step that creates a `build` directory, changes into that directory, runs `cmake ..`, and then runs `make`.\n4. The fourth step is a `Run tests` step that runs the tests.\n5. The fifth step is a `Save test times` step that uses the `actions/upload-artifact` action to save the test times to an artifact named `test-times`.\n6. The sixth step is a `Check test times` step that uses the `hendrikmuhs/ccache-action` action to check the test times. The `ccache-path` is set to `/usr/local/ccache`, the `ccache-max-size` is set to 10 GB, the `ccache-max-files` is set to 10,000, and the `ccache-max-files-soft` is set to 5,000.\n\nThe workflow uses the `github.ref` and `github.head_ref` variables to set the cache key and restore key.", "answer": "```yaml name: Check test times\non: [push, pull_request]\njobs:\n  check-test-times:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n    - name: Cache\n      uses: hendrikmuhs/ccache-action@v1.2\n      with:\n        key: linux-ci-build-times-${{ github.ref }}-${{ github.head_ref }}-${{ hashFiles('**/*.hpp', '**/*.cpp') }}\n        restore-keys: |\n          linux-ci-build-times-${{ github.ref }}-${{ github.head_ref }}-\n          linux-ci-build-times-${{ github.ref }}-\n          linux-ci-build-times-refs/heads/master-\n          linux-ci-build-times-\n    - name: Setup\n      run: |\n        sudo apt update\n        sudo apt install -y libboost-dev autoconf automake libtool ccache\n    - name: Build\n      run: |\n        ./autogen.sh\n        ./configure --disable-static CC=\"ccache gcc\" CXX=\"ccache g++\" CXXFLAGS=\"-O2 -g0\"\n        make -j 2\n    - name: Run tests\n      run: |\n        ./test-suite/quantlib-test-suite --logger=JUNIT,warning,faster.xml:HRF,message -- --faster\n        ./test-suite/quantlib-test-suite --logger=JUNIT,warning,fast.xml:HRF,message -- --fast\n        ./test-suite/quantlib-test-suite --logger=JUNIT,warning,all.xml:HRF,message\n    - name: Save test times\n      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3\n      with:\n        name: test-reports\n        path: ./all.xml\n    - name: Check test times\n      run: |\n        python ./tools/check_test_times.py\n```", "prompt": "Generate a GitHub Workflow named `Check test times` for a GitHub repository whose primary programming language is C++.

The `channel` variable can take the values `stable`, `beta`, or `dev`, and the `dependencies` variable can take the values `true` or `false`. The job has eight steps:\n\n1. Checkout the code using the `actions/checkout@v3` action.\n2. Set up the Flutter environment using the `subosito/flutter-action@v2` action. The `channel` and `dependencies` variables are passed as inputs to the action.\n3. Remove the `example` folder using the `rm -rf example` command.\n4. Install dependencies using `flutter pub get`.\n5. Check the format of the code using `flutter format --set-exit-if-changed .`.\n6. Generate code using `flutter generate`.\n7. Analyze the code using `flutter analyze`.\n8. Run tests using `flutter test`.\n\nThe workflow uses the `matrix` keyword to define the matrix strategy for the `channel` and `dependencies` variables. The `matrix` keyword allows you to define multiple values for each variable and run the workflow multiple times with different combinations of values.

Checkout code\n2. Set up Ruby\n3. Lint with RuboCop\n4. Setup Node.js\n5. Install Node modules\n6. Run ESLint\n7. Run Tests\n\nThe `deploy` job runs on the `ubuntu-latest` runner and uses the `postgres`, `redis`, and `opensearch` services. The job defines 4 steps:\n\n1. Checkout code\n2.

The workflow uses a matrix strategy to automatically create multiple job runs that are based on the combinations of the variables. The job `tests` has 6 steps:\n\n1. Checkout code\n2. Set up Python\n3. Install system dependencies\n4. Update pip\n5. Install dependencies\n6. Run tests\n\nThe `matrix` strategy defines the variables that are used to create the matrix combinations. The `name`, `python`, `os`, and `tox` variables are used to create the matrix combinations. The `name` variable is used to create a unique name for each job run, the `python` variable is used to specify the Python version to use, the `os` variable is used to specify the operating system to use, and the `tox` variable is used to specify the test environment to use.\n\nThe `steps` section defines the steps that are executed in each job run. The first step, `Checkout code`, uses the `actions/checkout` action to check out the code from the repository. The second step, `Set up Python`, uses the `actions/setup-python` action to set up the Python environment.

The workflow uses a matrix strategy to automatically create multiple job runs that are based on the combinations of the variables `name`, `openstack_version`, and `ubuntu_version`. The `additional-objects` key is used to add key:value pairs to each of the matrix combinations if none of the key:value pairs overwrite any of the original matrix values. The workflow has six steps: `Checkout Gophercloud`, `Deploy devstack`, `Checkout go`, `Run Gophercloud acceptance tests`, `Generate logs on failure`, and `Upload logs artifacts on failure`. The `Checkout Gophercloud` step uses the `actions/checkout@v2` action to check out the `Gophercloud` repository. The `Deploy devstack` step uses the `stack.sh` script to deploy the OpenStack environment. The `Checkout go` step uses the `go mod download` command to check out the `go` repository. The `Run Gophercloud acceptance tests` step uses the `go test -v ./...` command to run the acceptance tests for `Gophercloud`. The `Generate logs on failure` step uses the `failure()` function to check if the previous step failed, and if so, it runs the `go test -v ./...` command again.

The workflow has one job, `build`, which runs on an `ubuntu-latest` runner. The job has 9 steps:\n\n1. `Checkout`: This step uses the `actions/checkout` action tagged as `v3` to check out the repository. The `fetch-depth` input parameter is set to `0` to ensure that the entire repository history is checked out.\n2. `Bump version and push tag`: This step uses the `anothrNick/github-tag-action` action tagged as `1.52.0` to bump the version and push a new tag to the repository. The `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable is set to `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` to authenticate with the GitHub API. The `INITIAL_VERSION` environment variable is set to `1.0.0` to specify the initial version of the project. The `DEFAULT_BUMP` environment variable is set to `none` to prevent the version from being bumped automatically.\n3. `Set up QEMU`: This step uses the `docker/setup-qemu-action` action tagged as `v2` to set up QEMU for Docker builds. This step will only run if the `part` output of the `tagging` step is `true`.\n4. `Set up Docker Buildx`: This step uses the `docker/setup-buildx-action` action tagged as `v2` to set up Docker Buildx for Docker builds. This step will only run if the `part` output of the `tagging` step is `true`.\n5. `Login to DockerHub`: This step uses the `docker/login-action` action tagged as `v2` to log in to DockerHub. The `username` and `password` input parameters are set to `${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}` and `${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}`, respectively, to authenticate with DockerHub. This step will only run if the `part` output of the `tagging` step is `true`.\n6. `Login to Quay.io`: This step uses the `docker/login-action` action tagged as `v2` to log in to Quay.io. The `registry` input parameter is set to `quay.io`, the `username` input parameter is set to `${{ secrets.QUAY_BOT_USERNAME }}`, and the `password` input parameter is set to `${{ secrets.QUAY_BOT_PASSWORD }}`, respectively, to authenticate with Quay.io. This step will only run if the `part` output of the `tagging` step is `true`.\n7. `Build and push`: This step uses the `docker/build-push-action` action tagged as `v3` to build and push the Docker image to DockerHub and Quay.io. The `push` input parameter is set to `true` to push the image to the registry. The `platforms` input parameter is set to `linux/amd64,linux/arm64,linux/arm/v7,linux/ppc64le,linux/s390x` to specify the platforms to build for. The `tags` input parameter is set to `docker.io/kiwigrid/k8s-sidecar:latest\ndocker.io/kiwigrid/k8s-sidecar:${{ steps.tagging.outputs.tag }}\nquay.io/kiwigrid/k8s-sidecar:latest\nquay.io/kiwigrid/k8s-sidecar:${{ steps.tagging.outputs.tag }}\n` to specify the tags to push. This step will only run if the `part` output of the `tagging` step is `true`.\n8. `Build Changelog`: This step uses the `mikepenz/release-changelog-builder-action` action tagged as `v3` to build the changelog for the release. The `configuration` input parameter is set to `.github/workflows/release-notes-config.json` to specify the configuration file to use. This step will only run if the `part` output of the `tagging` step is `true`.\n9. `Create Github Release`: This step uses the `actions/create-release` action tagged as `v1` to create a new release on GitHub. The `tag_name` input parameter is set to `${{ steps.tagging.outputs.tag }}` to specify the tag to create the release for. The `release_name` input parameter is set to `v${{ steps.tagging.outputs.tag }}` to specify the name of the release. The `body` input parameter is set to `${{ steps.build_changelog.outputs.changelog }}` to specify the body of the release. The `draft` input parameter is set to `false` to make the release public. The `prerelease` input parameter is set to `false` to make the release a regular release. This step will only run if the `part` output of the `tagging` step is `true`.\n\nNote that this workflow assumes that the `tagging` step will set the `part` output to `true` if the version should be bumped and pushed.

The workflow has one job named `functional-orchestration` that uses the `ubuntu-${{ matrix.ubuntu_version }}` runner. The job has a matrix strategy that defines six job runs based on the combinations of the `name`, `openstack_version`, and `ubuntu_version` variables. The `name` variable has one value: `master`. The `openstack_version` variable has one value: `master`. The `ubuntu_version` variable has one value: `20.04`.\n\nThe `functional-orchestration` job has six steps:\n\n1. The first step checks out the Gophercloud repository using the `actions/checkout` action tagged as v3.\n2. The second step deploys the devstack using the `EmilienM/devstack-action` action tagged as v0.9. The action takes three input parameters: `branch`, `conf_overrides`, and `enabled_services`. The `branch` parameter is set to the `openstack_version` variable, the `conf_overrides` parameter is set to `enable_plugin heat https://opendev.org/openstack/heat ${{ matrix.openstack_version }}`, and the `enabled_services` parameter is set to `h-eng,h-api,h-api-cfn,h-api-cw`.\n3. The third step checks out the Go repository using the `actions/setup-go` action tagged as v3. The action takes one input parameter: `go-version` and sets it to `^1.15`.\n4. The fourth step runs the Gophercloud acceptance tests using a script named `acceptancetest`. The script sets two environment variables: `DEVSTACK_PATH` is set to the `github.workspace` variable and `ACCEPTANCE_TESTS_FILTER` is set to `^.*orchestration.*$`.\n5. The fifth step generates logs if the job fails using a script named `collectlogs`.\n6. The sixth step uploads the logs artifacts if the job fails using the `actions/upload-artifact` action tagged as v3. The action takes two input parameters: `name` and `path`. The `name` parameter is set to `functional-orchestration-${{ matrix.name }}` and the `path` parameter is set to `/tmp/devstack-logs/*`.", "answer": "```yaml name: functional-orchestration\non:\n  pull_request:\n    paths:\n      - '**orchestration**'\n  schedule:\n    - cron: '0 0 * * *'\njobs:\n  functional-orchestration:\n    strategy:\n      fail-fast: false\n      matrix:\n        name: [\"master\"]\n        openstack_version: [\"master\"]\n        ubuntu_version: [\"20.04\"]\n        include:\n          - name: \"yoga\"\n            openstack_version: \"stable/yoga\"\n            ubuntu_version: \"20.04\"\n          - name: \"xena\"\n            openstack_version: \"stable/xena\"\n            ubuntu_version: \"20.04\"\n          - name: \"wallaby\"\n            openstack_version: \"stable/wallaby\"\n            ubuntu_version: \"20.04\"\n          - name: \"victoria\"\n            openstack_version: \"stable/victoria\"\n            ubuntu_version: \"20.04\"\n          - name: \"ussuri\"\n            openstack_version: \"stable/ussuri\"\n            ubuntu_version: \"18.04\"\n          - name: \"train\"\n            openstack_version: \"stable/train\"\n            ubuntu_version: \"18.04\"\n    runs-on: ubuntu-${{ matrix.ubuntu_version }}\n    name: Deploy OpenStack ${{ matrix.name }} with Heat and run orchestration acceptance tests\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout Gophercloud\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - name: Deploy devstack\n        uses: EmilienM/devstack-action@v0.9\n        with:\n          branch: ${{ matrix.openstack_version }}\n          conf_overrides: |\n            enable_plugin heat https://opendev.org/openstack/heat ${{ matrix.openstack_version }}\n          enabled_services: 'h-eng,h-api,h-api-cfn,h-api-cw'\n      - name: Checkout go\n        uses: actions/setup-go@v3\n        with:\n          go-version: '^1.15'\n      - name: Run Gophercloud acceptance tests\n        run: ./script/acceptancetest\n        env:\n          DEVSTACK_PATH: ${{ github.workspace }}/devstack\n          ACCEPTANCE_TESTS_FILTER: ^.*orchestration.*$\n      - name: Generate logs on failure\n        run: ./script/collectlogs\n        if: failure()\n      - name: Upload logs artifacts on failure\n        if: failure()\n        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3\n        with:\n          name: functional-orchestration-${{ matrix.name }}\n          path: /tmp/devstack-logs/*\n```", "prompt": "Generate a GitHub Workflow named `functional-orchestration` for a GitHub repository whose primary programming language is Go.

The workflow also allows manual triggering.\n\nThe workflow uses the `ubuntu-latest` runner and has a single job named `test_conda_install`. The job has three steps:\n\n1. The first step checks out the repository using the `actions/checkout` action tagged as version 3.\n2. The second step builds a Conda environment using the `conda env create` command. The environment is created from a file named `conda-environment.yml`, which is created by the previous step. The `--prefix cylc-dev` option sets the environment prefix to `cylc-dev`.\n3. The third step checks for the presence of any activate scripts in the environment.

The job uses a matrix strategy to automatically create multiple job runs that are based on the combinations of the variables. The variable `node-version` has one value: 16.x. The job `build` has 6 steps. The 1st step is named ``. This step runs action `actions/checkout` tagged as v3. The 2nd step is named `Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}`. This step runs action `actions/setup-node` tagged as v3. The step defines an input parameter for the action: `node-version` is set to `${{ matrix.node-version }}`. The 3rd step is named `Cache pnpm modules`. The step sets an environment variable to use: `cache-name` is set to `cache-pnpm-modules`. This step runs action `actions/cache` tagged as v3. The step defines 3 input parameters for the action: `path` is set to `~/.pnpm-store`, `key` is set to `${{ runner.os }}-build-${{ env.cache-name }}-${{ matrix.node-version }}-${{ hashFiles('**/pnpm-lock.yaml') }}` and `restore-keys` is set to `${{ runner.os }}-build-${{ env.cache-name }}-${{ matrix.node-version }}-${{ hashFiles('**/pnpm-lock.yaml') }}\n`.
